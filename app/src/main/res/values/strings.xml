    <string name="about_us_sherman"><b>Hello!</b>\n\nWe are Burrd, a group of ten students from
        UC San Diego making
        a bold foray into the world of mobile app development. Burrd began as a project for our
        Software Engineering course.  We sought to create an app that would enable students to find
        the best value for food and drinks in their local area.\n\nOur team consists of Brenton
        Ang, Sherman Cheung, Adam Dorwat, Xu(Ken) He, Soham Jatakia,
        Chloe Lopez, David Liberman, Trent Miller, Anjali Patel, and Andrew Walters.  We are very
        proud to bring you this app and wish you the best of luck in your gastronomic endeavors.
        Happy Happy Hour!

    <string name="about_us_david">Burrd is a fusion between blurred and bird. Why? Because the
        BIRD is the <b>WORD</b>.\n\nThe Burrd is inspired by our lead software
        developer’s beloved Cockatiel who has an
        affinity for fine beers. We are a group of thrifty college students from UC San Diego who
        are always on the prowl for the best deals to get us drunk or full for as little money
        as possible.
