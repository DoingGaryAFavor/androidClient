    <string name="about_us_sherman"><b>Hello!</b>\n\n
        \tWe are Burrd, a group of ten students from UC San Diego making
        a bold foray into the world of mobile app development. Burrd began as a project for our
        Software Engineering course.  We sought to create an app that would enable students to find
        the best value for food and drinks in their local area.\n\n

        \tOur team consists of Brenton Ang, Sherman Cheung, Adam Dorwat, Xu(Ken) He, Soham Jatakia,
        Chloe Lopez, David Liberman, Trent Miller, Anjali Patel, and Andrew Walters.  We are very
        proud to bring you this app and wish you the best of luck in your gastronomic endeavors.
        Happy Happy Hour!

    <string name="about_us_david">\tBurrd is a fusion between blurred and bird. Why? Because BIRD
        is the <b>WORD</b>.\n\n
        The Burrd is inspired by our beloved software developerâ€™s Cockatiel who also has an
        affinity for fine beers. We are a group of thrifty college students from UC San Diego who
        are always on the prowl for the best deals to get us drunk or full for as little money
        as possible.
